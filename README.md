# Algorithm for Learning Mod-2-MA

Creator: Nevin George
Advisor: Dana Angluin
Program Description: The algorithm takes in as input a mod-2-MA and prints to stdout the MA obtained after learning the input function through a series of membership and equivalence queries. The algorithm is explained in more detail in the paper "Learning functions represented as multiplicity automata" by Beimel et al. The motivation behind this algorithm originally arose from Angluin's exact learning model described in her paper "Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples."
